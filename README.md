=====================

android_kernel_htc_m7 (HTC One)


Notice:

Kernel is based off of cyanogenmod 10.2 kernel. Needs to have cm commits merged for gpl. ATM, kernel will not build, synaptics touchscreen drivers still needs editing. The purpose of this kernel is to make sure no cpu's get fried due to overheating of the board by applying mpdecision and thermal tweaked to work for cm10.2 on all m7 models.
