android_kernel_htc_m7
=====================

android_kernel_htc_m7 (HTC One)

Notice:

Kernel is based off of cyanogenmod 10.2 kernel. The purpose of this kernel is to make sure no cpu's get fried due to overheating of the board by applying mpdecision and thermal tweaked to work for cm10.2 on all m7 models.


Edit:

so far the functions that are finished and fully working are s2w and all of the synaptic mods like pocket detection and logo2menu. plus, lionheart governor added as well as full thermal control. GCC fixes for linaro (built with 4.7) as well as BB mod by tbalden and some wakelock fixes for battery life improvements.
